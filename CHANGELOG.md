While GUARD is in the `0.x` series, behavior may change between minor versions.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- Documented the actual minimum OS as Windows 10 version 1809 (build 17763),
  matching the Windows App SDK floor, instead of "Windows 10 or 11".

### Fixed
- The App Inventory "Filter" label now sits inline to the left of the filter
  box, on the same row as the toolbar buttons, instead of floating above it.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-03

First public pre-release. WinUI 3 edition (.NET 10 + Windows App SDK 1.8),
shipping as a single self-contained `GUARD.exe`.

### Added
- File backup to any local, external, or network destination, built on Robocopy.
- Additive and Mirror copy modes.
- Folder- and file-name exclusions, one per line.
- Preview (dry-run) mode, per-folder progress, and a saved log of the last run.
- Optional daily scheduled task (`Daily GUARD Backup`) via a standalone,
  self-contained `guard-backup.cmd`.
- App Inventory: registry scan with winget enrichment, exportable to JSON.
- Dark / light Mica theming that follows the Windows setting.
- Screen-reader-first design: real check-box rows, single-tab-stop lists,
  arrow-key navigation, and re-entry focus memory.
