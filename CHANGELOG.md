# Changelog

All notable changes to GUARD are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
While GUARD is in the `0.x` series, behavior may change between minor versions.

## [Unreleased]

First public pre-release (v0.1.0, not yet tagged). WinUI 3 edition
(.NET 10 + Windows App SDK 1.8), shipping as a single self-contained `GUARD.exe`.
When tagging, move these entries under a `## [0.1.0] - <date>` heading.

### Added
- File backup to any local, external, or network destination, built on Robocopy.
- Additive and Mirror copy modes.
- Folder- and file-name exclusions, one per line.
- Preview (dry-run) mode, per-folder progress, and a saved log of the last run.
- Optional daily scheduled task (`Daily GUARD Backup`) via a standalone,
  self-contained `guard-backup.cmd`.
- App Inventory: registry scan with winget enrichment, exportable to JSON.
- Dark / light Mica theming that follows the Windows setting.
- Screen-reader-first design: real check-box rows, single-tab-stop lists,
  arrow-key navigation, and re-entry focus memory.
